# Enable coverate report target and compilation options

# In this project, 100% tests coverage does not actually mean much, because the most useful
# test cases are around overload resolution, parameter dispatch, value categories,
# concepts etc. elements of the language which may not show in the coverage tests.
# This means that we need many more tests than just the minimum needed to ensure good coverage.
