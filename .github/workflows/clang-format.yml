        PREAMBLE: |
          If you are reading this, you are looking at a failed Github Actions
          job. That means you pushed one or more source files that did not conform
          to the formatting specified in .clang-format. That may be because
          you neglected to run 'git clang-format' or 'clang-format' before
          committing, or perhaps your version of clang-format is not compatible
          with the one on this machine, which is:
        SUGGESTION: |

          To fix it, you can do one of two things:
          1. Download and apply the patch generated as an artifact of this
             job to your repo, commit, and push.
          2. Run 'git-clang-format --extensions cpp,hpp,ipp main'
             in your repo, commit, and push.
      run: |
        echo "${PREAMBLE}"
        clang-format-${CLANG_VERSION} --version
        echo "${SUGGESTION}"
        exit 1
